# 2CHANGE
2CHANGE is an online tool that aims to help its users invest their change in a responsible way. It comes 
in the form of an app that saves up spare change from banking transactions and subsequently invests 
the collected money. Not only will it offer a wide range of investing 
opportunities, including but not limited to mutual and index funds, real estate, 
NFTs, and crypto but it will also educate its users to give 
them the power to make their own decisions and set preferences with respect to 
risk profile and returns.

2CHANGE offers an innovative educational aspect to investing, with the goal of closing the 
investment gap between different demographics. According to previous research, images and videos 
should help explain the difficult topics around investing. Furthermore, jargon and needlessly technical
terms are avoided when possible. Educative features on the 2CHANGE platform 
should help the appâ€™s users to make responsible choices as to where their money is invested. 

2CHANGE thus does not rely on extreme technological innovations. Instead, it relies on giving its users 
the power of autonomy by giving them the tools they need to make their own investment decisions. 
This includes not only additional decision features, but also the tool of knowledge.

## Logins
Since the app is still in the development stage, a limited number of used has access to the demo version.
That is why I have created a generally accessible Google account for the purpose of testing the MVP.
